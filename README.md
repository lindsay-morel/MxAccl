# MemryX Accl
The MxAccl repository provides the **open-source code** for both the `mx_accl` runtime library and the `acclBench` benchmarking tool. These components enable seamless integration and performance measurement of C++ applications using the MemryX MX3 accelerator.

### MxAccl Library
The `mx_accl` library is designed to efficiently handle multi-model and multi-input streams. It offers:
- **Auto-threading Mode**: Where the library manages send and receive threads automatically, simplifying usage.
- **Manual-threading Mode**: Where the user manually creates and manages threads, providing greater control and customization.

This architecture helps maximize the performance of the MX3’s pipelined dataflow system, while also allowing users to manage resources and threading as needed.

### AcclBench Tool
The `acclBench` command line interface tool provides an easy way to benchmark model performance on the MX3 accelerator. It measures the latency and FPS of inference operations, capturing the performance from the host side, which includes driver and interface time. `acclBench` supports both single and multi-stream scenarios and is built using the high-performance MxAccl C++ API.


### Full Documentation
For detailed information on using the `mx_accl` library and `acclBench` tool, please visit the MemryX Developer Hub:
- **[MxAccl Library Documentation](https://developer.memryx.com/api/accelerator/accelerator.html)**
- **[Benchmark Tools Documentation](https://developer.memryx.com/tools/benchmark/benchmark.html)**

> **Note**: If you are looking for the **Python API** for the MemryX MX3 accelerator, please visit the [Developer Hub](https://developer.memryx.com/api/accelerator/accelerator.html) for documentation and usage examples. This repository only contains the **C++ version** of the library.


### Repository Overview
This repository contains the source code for the core `mx_accl` library and associated tools. These components are typically pre-built and packaged as `memx-accl` within the MemryX SDK.

> **IMPORTANT**: For most users, we highly recommend using the prebuilt `memx-accl` package provided by the  [MemryX SDK](https://developer.memryx.com), as it simplifies development and ensures all dependencies are properly managed.

## Recommended Installation: MemryX SDK

To simplify development and avoid building from source, install the `memx-accl` package through the MemryX SDK. The SDK includes precompiled libraries, drivers, and tools optimized for MemryX accelerators. Follow the **[installation guide](https://developer.memryx.com/get_started/)** for step-by-step instructions.

The **[MemryX Developer Hub](https://developer.memryx.com)** provides comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to get you started quickly.

## Advanced Installation: Building from Source

For advanced users who prefer to build the MxAccl library from source, follow these instructions:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/memryx/MxAccl.git
```

### Step 2: Build gRPC

*Outside* your MxAccl folder, we need to build a static library version of gRPC.

``` bash
# clone and make build dirs
git clone --recurse-submodules -b v1.68.2 --depth 1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/grpc/grpc
cd grpc
mkdir cmake/build
cd cmake/build

# configure gRPC and set it to install to $HOME/grpc_inst
cmake -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DgRPC_BUILD_GRPC_CSHARP_PLUGIN=OFF \
  -DgRPC_BUILD_GRPC_NODE_PLUGIN=OFF -DgRPC_BUILD_GRPC_OBJECTIVE_C_PLUGIN=OFF \
  -DgRPC_BUILD_GRPC_PHP_PLUGIN=OFF -DgRPC_BUILD_GRPC_RUBY_PLUGIN=OFF -DgRPC_BUILD_GRPC_PYTHON_PLUGIN=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/grpc_inst \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..

# build (will take a while)
make -j$(nproc)

# install to $HOME/grpc_inst
make install

```

### Step 3: Build MxAccl

```bash
mkdir build && cd build

# must include the path to grpc_inst here
PATH="$HOME/grpc_inst:$PATH" cmake .. [-DBUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Release]]
make -j
   ```

The above commands will build the MxAccl library, acclBench, and all unit tests.

### Additional Dependencies for Development

* Gtest: Required for running the unit test suite. You can find it [here](https://github.com/google/googletest).

* Test Models: Download the DFPs and source models for the unit tests from this [link](https://developer.memryx.com/example_files/mxaccl_tests_models.tar.xz) and extract them into the mx_accl/tests/models/ folder.


## Usage

### MxAccl
The typical use of `MxAccl` is to integrate it directly into your C++ application to manage model inference on the MemryX MX3 accelerator. For complete documentation and detailed integration tutorials, visit the [MxAccl Documentation](https://developer.memryx.com/api/accelerator/accelerator.html) and [Tutorials Page](https://developer.memryx.com/tutorials/tutorials.html).

#### mx_server
Starting with the 1.1 release, the `mx_server` process must always be running, even if you're not using Shared mode, in order for the daemon to manage locks/access to connected MX3 devices.

So before starting any tests or example apps, run the `mx_server` command in a separate terminal and leave it going.

``` bash
./mx_server/mx_server
```


Now to verify your setup, you can run the unit tests with the following command:

```bash
cd build
ctest
```


### acclBench

To measure the performance (latency and FPS) of a model on the MemryX MX3 accelerator, use the `acclBench` command line tool. Here's how to get started:


#### Step 1: Obtain a DFP Model File
You can download a precompiled MobileNet DFP file from the link below:

- [MobileNet DFP Download](https://developer.memryx.com/_downloads/2925dc76b5b06046a0f3d66815b1ae5e/mobilenet.dfp)

For more information on creating and using DFP files, refer to the [Hello MXA Tutorial](https://developer.memryx.com/get_started/hello_mxa.html).


#### Step 2: Run acclBench
Once you have the DFP file and have successfully installed the MemryX SDK, drivers, and runtime libraries, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the MobileNet DFP file and run:

```bash
acclBench -d mobilenet.dfp -f 1000
```

##### Explanation of the Command

* `-d mobilenet.dfp`: Specifies the DFP model file to be used for benchmarking.
* `-f 1000`: Sets the number of frames for testing inference performance. The default is 1000 frames.

## Pre/Post Plugins

For Onnx, Tensorflow, and TFLite pre/post plugins, refer to the [MxUtils](https://github.com/memryx/MxUtils) repository. These plugins are packaged separately to minimize dependencies for the core MxAccl library and are only required if pre/post models are used.
